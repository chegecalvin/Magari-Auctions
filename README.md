## About Us

Magari auctions is a CLI application paired with SQLite which helps manage the database. Magari auctions is an interactive application which can be used by both the person putting up a car for auction and the people taking part in the auction who are the participants.

## Features

The application allows a user to put up a car for action as well as remove it after an auction has ended. One can also retrieve all cars on auction or search for a specific car by its id. A user can also take part in the auction by registering as a participant and they can also be removed depending on the situation. One can retrieve all participants or search for one either by id or by name.
